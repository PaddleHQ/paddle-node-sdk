# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Check our main [developer changelog](https://developer.paddle.com/?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-node-sdk) for information about changes to the Paddle Billing platform, the Paddle API, and other developer tools.

### Versioning

When we make [non-breaking changes](https://developer.paddle.com/api-reference/about/versioning?utm_source=dx&utm_medium=paddle-node-sdk#non-breaking-change) to the Paddle API, we'll only release a new major version of the Node.js SDK when it causes problems at runtime. We won't release a new version of the SDK when we weaken TypeScript types in a way that doesn't cause existing implementations to break or malfunction. For example, if we add a new field to a request or an allowed value for a field in a response, this weakens the Typescript type but does not cause existing usages to stop working.

This means when upgrading minor versions of the SDK, you may notice type errors. You can safely ignore these or fix by adding additional type guards.
